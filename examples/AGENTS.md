# Agentic Framework: Core Principles

## Definition
Agents are autonomous entities capable of planning, executing, and verifying tasks.

## Design Patterns
1. **Tool Use**: Equipping agents with specialized functions.
2. **Self-Correction**: Iterative refinement based on feedback.
3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Orchestrating multiple experts.

## Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate**: % of tasks completed correctly.
- **Efficiency**: Tool calls per task.
- **Latency**: End-to-end processing time.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid over-complicating agent prompts; prioritize clarity and constraints.
